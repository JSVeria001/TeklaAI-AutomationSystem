6. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S)

## Step 4: Initialize Git Repository in Visual Studio

### Option A: Using Visual Studio Git Integration (Recommended)

1. Go to **Git** → **Create Git Repository** (in the menu bar at top)
2. A dialog opens with options:
   - **✅ Local repository only** (select this initially)
   - Repository path: Should show your solution folder
3. Click **Create and Push** (or **Create** if only local)

### Option B: Using Git Changes Window

1. Open **View** → **Git Changes** (Ctrl+0, Ctrl+G)
2. Click **"Create Git Repository"** button
3. Follow the same steps as Option A

### What Just Happened?

Visual Studio has:
- ✅ Initialized a Git repository in your solution folder
- ✅ Created a `.git` folder (hidden) to store version history
- ✅ Detected all files in your solution
- ✅ Applied `.gitignore` rules

---

## Step 5: Make Your First Commit

### Review Changes

1. Open **Git Changes** window (View → Git Changes)
2. You'll see all files listed under **"Changes"** section
3. These are all the files ready to be committed

### Stage Files

Files are automatically staged, but you can:
- **Stage individual files**: Click **+** next to a file
- **Unstage files**: Click **-** next to a file
- **Stage all**: Files are usually all staged by default

### Create the Commit

1. In the **Git Changes** window, find the **commit message box** at the top
2. Enter a descriptive message:
```
   Initial project structure setup
   
   - Created 6 projects (Core, API, Modelling, Drawing, Extraction, UI)
   - Added Tekla API references
   - Set up folder structure
   - Added .gitignore
```
3. Click **"Commit All"** button

**Congratulations! 🎉** You've made your first commit!

## Step 6: Understanding Git in Visual Studio

### Git Changes Window (Your Main Interface)

**Location**: View → Git Changes (Ctrl+0, Ctrl+G)

**Sections you'll see:**

1. **Commit message box** - Where you write what you changed
2. **Changes** - Files that have been modified/added
3. **Commit All** button - Save changes to Git history
4. **Outgoing/Incoming commits** - For when you use GitHub/remote

### Git Repository Window (View History)

**Location**: View → Git Repository (Ctrl+0, Ctrl+R)

Shows:
- All previous commits
- Branches
- Commit history timeline
- Who made what changes and when

---

## Step 7: Daily Git Workflow

### Every Time You Make Changes:

**1. Write some code** (e.g., create BeamRecognizer.cs)

**2. Save your work** (Ctrl+S)

**3. Review changes:**
   - Open **Git Changes** window
   - You'll see modified files listed

**4. Commit your work:**
   - Write a commit message describing what you did:
```
     Added BeamRecognizer class
     
     - Implements pattern recognition for beam elements
     - Reads DWG line segments
     - Returns beam definitions with start/end points
```
   - Click **Commit All**

**5. Repeat** as you work

### Commit Message Best Practices:

✅ **Good commit messages:**
```
Added ConnectionGenerator class with bolt capacity calculation

Implemented EurocodeValidator for steel beam checks

Fixed bug in DwgReader where polylines weren't being parsed

Updated SmartPlacer algorithm to handle corner cases
```

❌ **Bad commit messages:**
```
fixed stuff
